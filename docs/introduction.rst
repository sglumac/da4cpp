============

**da4cpp** (Dependency Analysis for C++) is an application based on [libclang](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibClang.html) designed to analyze dependencies in C++ code.
Its primary goal is to produce a dependency graph that helps developers visualize relationships between different components of their C++ projects.
